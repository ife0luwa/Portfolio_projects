This Repository will hold all of my practice SQL code and queries. Identify(with name) and check out the visualization to each code on my tableau: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/babalola.ifeoluwa .

Please feel free to take these and modify for your use. Make them your own and find you own insights

I really do hope this is helpful and make you learn a few things.
